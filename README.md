# The-Blader-Handbook
Add a Beyblade class into Pathfinder

## List of features to be added:
- Blader spirit: Would work similar to a Monk's Ki Pool, giving the Blader access to a set of powerful abilities that can be called upon a few times per day.
- Special Moves: At specific level milestones (Maybe every 10 lvls) a Blader can permanantly upgrade his Bey with a powerful special move.
